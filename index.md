## About Me

<img class="profile-picture" src="sherlock.jpg">

Hi! I am studying Computer Science and Mathematics at Roskilde Univeristy:

Here are some of my projects:

## [local-next-month](https://github.com/spralja/local-next-month)

Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit. Aliquam finibus ipsum ac erat aliquam dapibus. Vestibulum vehicula placerat ex, a consectetur odio pharetra quis. Mauris id urna ante. Fusce pharetra diam ac nisi aliquet, vel egestas ex iaculis. Pellentesque laoreet cursus tellus sed pellentesque. Praesent a rhoncus elit. Nunc ipsum nisl, consequat sit amet pretium quis, gravida id ipsum.

## auto-commuter
Github: [src](https://github.com/spralja/auto-commuter), [demo](https://spralja.github.io/auto-commuter)

## Developing a General Purpose Programming Langugage and an IDE
GitHub: [pychart](https://github.com/miningape/pychart), [IDE](https://github.com/SirPaws/pychart-frontend) rucforsk: [paper](https://rucforsk.ruc.dk/ws/files/81549196/Final_Report.pdf)
 
Designing and implementing a new programming language has been a task of many programmers for the past decades. Hundreds of programming languages have been implemented throughout the history of Computer Science with many differences (Fowler, 2020). The programming languages developed throughout the years laid in different paradigms (e.g. functional, imperative etc.) (Nørmark, 2011). The implementation of these languages have varied and there are many techniques for implementing different sorts of PL’s. In this project, we implemented a new imperative programming language called Pychart using Python and an Integrated Development Environment for this new language was developed using the Flutter Framework.

## [path-finding-algorithms](https://github.com/spralja/path-finding-algorithms)

Finding the shortest path between two places in a fast and efficient way is a problem
that many are looking to solve. In our report we looked at this problem in a unique
way by implementing and comparing some path-finding algorithms in the p5.js editor.
We looked at 4 methods of path-finding each with a different approach to solving the
problem. We tested these 4 algorithms on maps we created to find their performance
in time, complexity, etc. We used these factors to compare all the algorithms and find
out which perform best in different cases. In the end we found that the A* algorithm
performed the best based on the tests that were done.

## Mathematical Modelling of Quantum Mechanical Crystal Lattice Systems

Two models for solutions to Schrödinger’s equation in a one dimensional crystal lattice are presented: a Kronig-Penny model and a
model based on the Mathieu equation. We also tried to extend the
Kronig-Penny model to two dimensions, as well as having laid out a
method for finding the Fourier coefficients of a charge in three dimensional space which we believe would be useful for others attempting
to solve the Schrödinger equation in higher dimensions. Due to limitations, some of the models are flawed and would require further
theoretical investigation. These are discussed at the end.

## Superhydrophobic Coatings as a Drag Reduction Method 

Superhydrophobic materials (SHPMs) could potentially have great benefit to many aspects of
science and society. This paper assesses them as a means of reducing drag in the maritime industry.
We give defining characteristics of turbulent flow to contrast with laminar flow, and we examine
fluid drag to assess the viability of the technology. We introduce slip and relate it to lowering drag
and thus emissions. We estimate the potential drop in CO2 emissions from using this technology
in ideal conditions. We also investigate the superhydrophobic state and how it’s caused, measured
and how it contrasts to other aspects of fluid-surface contact. We investigate how microstructures
on surfaces effect drag, as well as their composition. The paper also considers the problem of
biofouling and discusses the current state of technology regarding the coating of marine vessels.
We offer a rough estimate of the amount of CO2 reduction for our chosen microstructures and
discuss the problems with our assumptions. Finally, we present the problems SHPMs encounter in
real world circumstances and imagine an ‘ideal’ superhydrophobic material and discuss which
properties would be essential to making it viable. We end by concluding on SHPMs viability and
future potential.
